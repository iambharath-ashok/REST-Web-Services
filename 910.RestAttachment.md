# REST Attachments

-	File uploading and downloading is possible from HTTP Standard
-	HTTP Post method is used to upload the file as part of HTTP Stream
	-	Entire file content will be sent as stream to server as a multipart
-	HTTP Get method can be used to download the files to browser or REST Applications

	Code Snippet of uploading the file with Form:
	
		
		<!Doctype html>
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>File Upload</title>
				<meta charset="UTF-8"/>
			</head>
			<body>
				<form action="/services/fileService/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
					<p>File Location: <input type="file" name="photo"/></p>
					<input type="submit" value="Upload"/>
				</form>
			</body>
		</html>
		
-	Framework like CXF, Jersey can bind the incoming files to Java Objects like Attachments
	- 	From these Java Objects we can get a Stream Object and saved in to Hard Disk
	
-	To send the file as an attachment 
	-	We can create java.io.File and point to file in the hard disk 
	-	And send the java.io.File as output in the response
	

##	Methods and URIs for uploading and downloading the Attachments

-	Upload
	-	POST /fileService/upload
	
-	Download 
	-	GET /fileService/download
	
	
## Create the Project for REST Attachments

-	Create Spring Boot application with CXF dependency
-	Add the cxf properties in application.properties


	server.context-path=/
	cxf.jaxrs.component-scan=true
	
-	Place the fileUpload.jsp in resource/static dir


## Implementation of Attachment Upload Endpoint

- @Path is the annotation from the jawax.ws.rs package of Java JAX-RS


	Code Snippet:
	
	
		import javax.ws.rs.POST;
		import javax.ws.rs.Path;
			
		@Path("/fileService")
		public  class FileService {
		
			String FILE_NAME = "";
			
			@Path("/upload")
			@POST
			public void upload(List<Attachment> attachments) {
				for(Attachment attachment: attachments) {
					copyFile(attachment.getDataHandler().getInputStream());
				}
			}
			
			private void copyFile(InputStream inputStream) {
				OutputStream outputStream = null;
				
				try{
					outputStream = new FileOutputStream(new File(FILE_NAME));
					byte [] buffer = new byte[1024];
					
					while(inputStream.read(buffer) > -1) {
						outputStream.write(buffer);
					}
					
					outputStream.flush();
					outputStream.close();
				}
				catch(IOExpection e) {
					e.printStacktrace();
				}
			}
		}


## Implementation of Client to Upload REST Attachment

-	Create a Spring Boot application
-	Add the cxf-rt-rs-client dependency
		
		
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
			<artifactId>cxf-rt-rs-client</artifactId>
			<version>3.2.1</version>
		</dependency>
	
-	FileClient

	Code Snippet of File Uploading
	
		
		public class FileServiceClient {
		
			private static String FILE_NAME = "";
			public static void main(String ... args) {
				
				WebClient webClient = WebClient.create("http://localhost:8080/restattachments/service/upload");
				webClient.type("multipart/form-data");
				
				ContentDisposition contentDisposition = new ContentDisposition("attachment;filename=Webservice.jpg");
				Attachment attachment = new Attachment("root", new FileInputStream(new File(FILE_NAME])), contentDisposition);
				webClient.post(attachment);
			}
		}



## Implementation of Attachment Download


-	Create a endpoint for the download the files


	Code Snippet:
	
		import javax.ws.rs.POST;
		import javax.ws.rs.Path;
			
		@Path("/fileService")
		public  class FileService {
		
			String FILE_NAME = "";
			
			@Path("/upload")
			@POST
			public void upload(List<Attachment> attachments) {
				for(Attachment attachment: attachments) {
					copyFile(attachment.getDataHandler().getInputStream());
				}
			}
			
			private void copyFile(InputStream inputStream) {
				OutputStream outputStream = null;
				
				try{
					outputStream = new FileOutputStream(new File(FILE_NAME));
					byte [] buffer = new byte[1024];
					
					while(inputStream.read(buffer) > -1) {
						outputStream.write(buffer);
					}
					
					outputStream.flush();
					outputStream.close();
				}
				catch(IOExpection e) {
					e.printStacktrace();
				}
			}
			
			
			@GET
			@Path("/download")
			public Response download() {
				File file = new File(FILE_NAME);
				ResponseBuilder resposneBuilder =  Response.ok(file);
				responseBuilder.header("Content-Disposition", "attachment;filename=Webservices.jpg");
				return responseBuilder.build();
			}
		}
