##	REST and Spring Security


-	We can enable security at endpoints level and with basic authentication using spring security
-	By default spring will generate some random text and it will changes once server restart
-	We need to add username and password properties of spring security feature
-	Client while sending the request needs to send with basic authentication with username and password
-	POST request has some issues 

	-	We need to disable csrf at server side
	
	
	
## Spring Security Properties at server side on application.properties

-	spring.security.user.name=customer
-	spring.security.user.password=customer



## Implementing Spring Security

-	Create a Spring Boot application
-	Create couple of service with Endpoints
-	Publish the endpoints
-	Add Properties specific to Cxf for scanning endpoints and root context path
-	Add JAXB and JAX-RS annotations on top of Model and Service Interface Classes
-	Add spring-boot-starter-security dependency
-	Spring Boot will automatically enable all the security related configuration and generates some random password at server bootup time
-	In order to have specific consistent username and password, we need to add spring security related username and password properties to application.properties file
-	While sending request from client we need send request with Basic Authentication by passing username and password
-	By default POST Request with Spring Security is having issues:
	-	We need to disable the csrf feature by implmenting WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
	
	
	Code Snippet of Enabling Spring Security with HTTP POST:
	
		public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
			
			@Override
			protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) {
				http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated().and().httpBasic().and().csrf().disable();
			}
		
		}
