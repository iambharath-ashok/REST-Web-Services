##	REST and Spring Security


-	We can enable security at endpoints level and with basic authentication using spring security
-	By default spring will generate some random text and it will changes once server restart
-	We need to add username and password properties of spring security feature
-	Client while sending the request needs to send with basic authentication with username and password
-	POST request has some issues 

	-	We need to disable csrf at server side
	
	
	
## Spring Security Properties at server side on application.properties

-	spring.security.user.name=customer
-	spring.security.user.password=customer
