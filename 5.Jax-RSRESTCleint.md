# JAX-RS Client API - Creating REST Clients

-	There are various clients to consume REST Services 

	1.	java.net.URL class
		-	Using this class we can open the connection to target URL 
		-	All the low level API will be taken care by Jdk
		
	2.	Apache HTTP Client API
	
		-	More advanced than java.net.URL
		-	Easier to use than java.net.URL
		
	3.	JAX-RS Client API
	
		-	This is standard API specification from Oracle 
		-	We can use the Annotations from JAX-RS API to consume the service from service provider
		-	Implementation will be provided by web service stack engines
		-	Advantage of using JAX-RS Client API is that 
			-	It will be easier to switch from client implementation to another
			-	Few JAX-RS Client API implementations were
				
				-	Jersey
				-	Apache Cxf
				-	Rest Easy
		
	
## JAX-RS Client API

	-	Easy way to create RESTful Client Application is by using JAX-RS client API and its annotations
	- 	Key interfaces of JAX-RS Client API are 
	
		-	Client Builder 
			- 	Starting point and used to build the client
				
		-	Client 
			- communication channel used to communicate b/w rest client and rest server
			
		-	Web target 
			- Unique resource or URL on the server
	
		-	Invoker.Builder 
			- 	Invoker is used to invoke HTTP methods like
			-	GET POST PUT
			
		-	Entity 
			- 	Data and data type that needs to be exchanged
		
	-	Implementation for this interfaces will be provided by Web-service stacks like Jersey, CXF
	
	
	
## Steps to implement JAX-RS Client

-	Create Spring Boot Application
-	Add the Rest Cxf client

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
			<artifactId>cxf-rt-rs-client</artifactId>
			<version>3.3.1</version>
		</dependency>

-	Create the Client Code to invoke the target

	Code Snippet:
	
		Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
		WebTarget target = client.target("http://localhost:8080/restws/services/patientservice/patients/123");
		Builder request = target.request();
		Response response = request.get();
		System.out.println(response.getStatus());


	Dynamic Processing of Url


		Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
		WebTarget target  = client.target(""http://localhost:8080/restws/services/patientservice").path("/{id}");
		target.resolveTemplate("id",123);
		
		Builder request = target.request();
		Patient patient = request.get(Patient.class);
		
		System.out.println(patient.getId());
		System.out.println(patient.getName());
