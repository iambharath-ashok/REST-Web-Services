# Rest Services

SECTION 16:


## REST Web service concepts

- 	REST - Representation State Transfer
- 	REST supports multiple data formats because HTTP supports MIME Types
- 	REST is stateless as HTTP is stateless
- 	State is maintained at client side and not at server side
- 	REST resources are easy to access
- 	REST provides single interface to perform curd operations
-	When server gets restarted ... we will be able to perform same set of operations



## RESTFULL Services Advantages

- 	REST Resources are easy to access
- 	REST is interoperable and supports multiple formats
- 	Interoperability  and multiple data formats 
	- 	Applications written any language can communicate with each other using http
- 	Scalability 
	- 	We can easily scale the applications to multiple servers through load balancers
	-	Horizontal scalable
	- 	Cache can be enabled at client side so that performance of application wil increase
- 	Availability - more the instances of apps, availability will gets increase

##	When to use RESTFul Services

-	When no formal Contract is required
	-  	REST will be used when  both producer and consumer have an mutual understanding of contract
		- 	Contract -> what is the data format and how to consume the service
		- 	When there is no formal contract is required b/w producer and consumer
		
- 	When multiple data format support is required
- 	When Low Bandwidth and less Memory is required on the N/w
	- 	unlike soap, messages reduces overhead in mobile devices
	- 	consumer less bandwidth -> required for mobile devices
	- 	faster data exchange

- 	When Caching is required
	- 	HTTP Statelessness allows us to cache all webservices responses
	- 	Cache will increase the application response as we can send the response from cache instead of application sending the response back
		- 	caching framework can be used 
		- 	just needs to configure them
		
- 	When existing Logic needs to be easily exposed
	- 	Saves lots of times and developer productivity
		- 	Can make use for new UI frameworks like angular and android
		- 	Easy to integrate with new frameworks and mobile devices
		
		
		
		
## REST 

- 	HTTP STATUS Codes 
	200 to 300
	400 to 500
	
- 	One Single interface for performing CRUD operations	
	- 	PUT, DELETE, GET, POST
	- 	Developer needs to know only about HTTP methods
	
##	WHY REST is Required
-	1 Single Interface
-	2 EASY to Access
-	3 Multiple Data formats
-	3 Statelessness
-	4 Availability
-	5 Scalability
-	6 Faster Integration
-	7 Less bandwidth and memory
-	9 Caching 	
-	10 Interoperability

## WHEN
-	1. No formal contract
-	2. Multiple data formats
-	3. Less bandwidth
-	4. Statelessness
