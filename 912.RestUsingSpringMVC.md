# REST with Spring MVC

-	Spring is a dependency Injection Framework
-	Over the years spring started supporting other framework integrations like

	-	JDBC
	-	ORM
	-	JMS
	-	MVC

-	Starting from Spring 3.0, Spring started supporting REST with MVC
-	Spring doesn't implement JAX-RS Specification and Annotations
-	Spring has its own set of Annotations and integrations
	
	-	@RequestMapping -> @Path
	-	@PathVariable -> @PathParam

## Spring MVC Flow

-	Client makes HTTP Request to Application
-	Incoming HTTP Request will be handled by Dispatcher Servlet in Spring MVC Application
-	Dispatcher Sevlet is a FrontController, it handles all the incoming requests
-	Dispatcher Servlet then reads Handler Mapping or Scans through all the controllers for the appropriate handler mapping
-	Dispatcher Servlet then sends request to Handler Mapping 
-	Handler Mapping then executes the business logic and returns a Json or xml response
-	If its a Spring MVC application then it will send the next view to Dispatcher Servlet
-	Dispatcher Servlet will create a appropriate response and send them to client
-	If its a Spring MVC application, view resolver will be configured to send next appropriate view to Dispatcher Servlet
-	If it's a REST application, then a appropriate response in Json or Xml will be sent back to client


## REST Project Configuration with Spring MVC

-	Create a Maven Web-Application 
-	Add the following dependencies

	-	Spring-webmvc
	-	jackson-core
	-	jackson-databind
	-	jackson-annotations

-	Create and configured Dispatcher servlet in the web.xml file
-	Create servlet and serlvet mapping for Dispatcher Servlet with url mapping '/*'
-	Create a POJO or Domain Object
-	Return the POJO as the response from the method
-	Spring 4.0 will automatically scans the converters dependencies at runtime and returns the response with that converters
-	No needs to configure the converters manually in the Spring Configuration file

##	Spring MVC Configuration with Xml file


-	Create a spring config file
-	Define below two elements in the spring configuration file

	<context:component-scan base-package=""/>
	-	Above element tells the spring to scan for components, controllers,RestControllers on the specified packages

	<mvc:annotation-driver/>
	-	Above elements tells the spring that use the annotation configuaration
