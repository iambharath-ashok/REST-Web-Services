# Asynchronous REST

## Synchronous REST Flow

-	Client will send request to server 
-	Server will process the request and send the response 200 after sometime
-	If any error then server will send the error 400 to client
-	Problem with Synchronous REST is that client will idle and till gets response  from server 
-	If server takes long time to process the request then client needs to wait for that amount of time without doing any work
-	Asynchronous REST can be used to overcome this problem

## Asynchronous REST Flow

-	In Asynchronous REST Flow, when client makes to request it will be send 202 response 
	- Meaning that it's not the actual response, it notifies that it received client request with 202 response code
-	Once request processed completely then server is send actual response with 200 status code
-	Asynchronous REST can be implemented at both client and server side
-	JAX-RS support Asynchronous REST at both client and server side
-	Asynchronous REST runs in multi threaded model

## Asynchronous Client

-	Asynchronous Call at client can implemented in two ways

	-	Polling 
		-	Client will keep polling the server for response from client at particular interval
		
	-	Callback Handler Method
		-	Callback handler method will be invoked when client got response from server
		
		
		
## 	Asynchronous REST implementation

### Provider or Server Side

-	Request or method will be made Asynchronous by adding the AsyncResponse as parameter and bind that param with @Suspended annotation
-	javax.ws.rs.container.AsyncResponse and javax.ws.rs.container.Suspended
-	java.util.concurrent.Future is handle the Async response

		
###  Client Side

-	Polling 
	-	javax.ws.rs.client.AysncInvoker is used to implement the polling mechanism
	
-	Callback Handler
	-	javax.ws.rs.client.InvocationCallback is implement Callback Handler mechanism
	 
	
	
	Code Snippet:

		Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
		WebTarget target = client.target("http://localhost:8080/restaysncws/services/checkprocess/checks");
		AsyncInvoker invoker = target.request().async();
		
		Future<Boolean> repsonse = invoker.post(Entity.entity(new CheckList(), MediaType.APPLICATION_XML),Boolean.class);
		
		response.get()
