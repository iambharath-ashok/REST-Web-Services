# Configuring JSON Support to REST Services with JAX-RS


-	Apache CXF by default support for Xml Data Format for exchanging messages b/w applications
-	In order to support Json data format we need to add Jackson dependencies
-	Jackson is a third party opensource API which supports serializing and deserializing Json to Java Objects


##  Steps to add JSON support to REST Services with JAX-RS endpoints

-	1. Add the Jackson Dependencies
		jackson-jaxrs
		jackson-xc

-	2.	Change the configuration

		cxf.jaxrs.classes-scan = true
		cxf.jaxrs.classes-scan-packages= 
		
-	3. Add @Consumes and @Produces annotations on top of Service interface classes


-	4.	Client while sending the request should send the message with data format header details

	-	Content-type and Accept headers
