##	SECTION 17 : REST Implementation

## 4 Design Steps for RESTFul services
-	1. Identify the resources that needs to expose as service
	
	-	DTO's or POJO's are the resources in REST Services
	-	These DTO's will be exposed with set of methods as service
		
-	2. Create the endpoints to access the resources
	
	-	Create the endpoint URIs
	-	EX:
			Creating Patient 
			
				/patients
			
			READing Patient
			
				/patients/{id}
			
			Updating Patient
				
				/patients/
				
			Removing Patient 

				/patient/{id}
			
-	3. Assign the HTTP methods
		
		1.	GET 
		2. 	POST 
		3.	Delete
		4.	PUT
	
-	4. Choose the data format for exchange b/w applications
		
	-	TEXT 
	-	XML 
	-	JSON
	
## JAX-RS

-	JAX-RS is a Java specification and API from Oracle
- 	Specification: 
	
	- 	Is a set of rule and guidelines
	- 	That Webservice engines like CXF and Jersey will implement the specification(JAX-RS) standards

- 	API
	- 	Developers will implement the APIs by using the annotations
	- 	API is consists of annotations

- 	JAX-RS annotations are available from javax.ws.rs package
	
- 	Annotations 
	-	JAX-RS annotation is from java.ws.rs.* package
	-	Resources needs to marked with JAX-RS Path Annotations
		- 	@Path("/users/{username}")
	
	- 	Http methods Annotations provided by JAX-RS 
		- 	@Get
		- 	@Put
		- 	@Post
		- 	@Delete
		
	- Data Formats Annotations provided by JAX-RS
		- 	@Consumes("text/plain")
		- 	@Produces({"application/xml","application/json"})
	
	- 	Parameters Mapping Annotations used by JAX-RS
		-	Data coming from Request will be mapped to Java Object
		- 	@PathParam
		- 	@QueryParam
		- 	@FormParam
		
	-	Exception Mappers annotations provided by JAX-RS
		-	@Provider
	


## JAX-RS API
		
	-	Jax-rs API has annotations and interfaces, classes from javax.ws.rs.* package
	-	JAX-RS Annotations are categorized into below 
	
		-	URI Mapping
		-	HTTP Methods
		- 	Data Formats
		-	Params
		-	Exception Mapping
		
## Implementation of REST Project

- 	1.	Creating the REST Project
	- 	start.spring.io
	- 	create the spring boot app
	-
-	2. 	Add the cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxrs dependency

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
			<artifactId>cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxrs</artifactId>
			<version>3.3.1</version>
		</dependency>

-	3.	Create the Resource classes and add JAXB annotations to classes
-	4.	Create the service classes and JAX-RS URI or Path Annotations
-	5.	Publish endpoint 

	-	add below property to application.properties
	
		cxf.jaxrs.component-scan = true
		server.servlet.context-path = /restws
		
		
## Test JAX-RS Spring Boot application with Postman

-	GET all patient
-	CREATE  patient
-	DELETE Patient
-	UPDATE Patient
